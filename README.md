# CLV Project
Using Google Merchandise Transaction Data to estimate the Customer Lifetime Value for returning customers.
This notebook provides an example of training a customer "lifetime" value model for newly acquired e-commerce customers. It is meant to outline the minimum steps required to train this type of model and can be used as a starting point for your project. It is not meant to illustrate best practices or preferred approaches for this type of modeling.

The notebook references publicly available sample of Analytics 360 data, which is accessible through Google Cloud Platform's BigQuery data warehouse. The data was collected from the Google Merchandise Store, which sells Google promotional products like t-shirts, pens, phone accessories, mugs, etc.

For each newly acquired customer, we would like to make an estimate of the future revenue we can expect from this customer. We will make a prediction one week after the customer is acquired to estimate their revenue up to 90 days after their acquisition date. By combining this predicted revenue with the actual revenue generated from the customer's first purchase and any subsequent purchase during their first week, we can get a more hollistic view of the value of the acquisition. By providing this value (first transaction revenue + subsequent week 1 revenue + day 8-90 predicted revenue) to Google advertising platforms, Google can automatically optimize digital ads to help acquire higher value new customers.
